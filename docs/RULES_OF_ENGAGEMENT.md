# The Developer's Pact: Must Comply With All Principles For All Tasks
 This document outlines the core principles and conventions we will follow in this project. All AI assistants and human developers must adhere to these rules for building high-quality, maintainable software._

### Principle 1: Communication Protocol
- **Every time a Step of a Task is done -> run the following command in shell: ```say "step done"```**
- **Every time a Task is done -> run the following command in shell: ```say "task done"```**
- **Every time a Development Plan is done run the following command in shell: ```say "development plan completed"```**
- **Every time you have a question, before asking me anything you have to run the following command in shell: ```say "question [the_question_you_need_to_ask]"```**
- **Every time you finished a task and you go to idle because the is nothing else to complete run the following command in shell: ```say "idle"```**
- **Every time user interaction is expected (i.e: asking for user permission to execute command) run the following command in shell: ```say "waiting for your answer?"```**
- **Every time context is being generated md files to MCP server run the following command in shell: ```say "context loaded to MCP server"```**
- **Every time you interact with git command run the following command in shell: ```say "[content]"``` (content - for example - i commited and pushed [detail_changes] to branch [branch_name])**
- **Executing the command ``` say ...`` is hereby pre-approved and should be executed without asking for permission/approval or any condition** 
- **For User interaction/questions/updates/progress reporting/explanations/all other communications user interaction, updates, questions, progress reporting and any other case** 
- **progress tracking transparency is a high priority and mandatory - every 30 minutes (at most) use ```say``` command to report what is being done, confirm you have progress - if no reporting will be done the assumption is that youre in an infinit loop and should be restarted**
- **To prevent more than one audio played simultaneously -> between execution of two say consecutive commands always wait 2 seconds**

### Principle 2: Research Tasks
- **Never Change Codebase:** For Tasks of researching/learning/finding data/calculating/executing commands(/etc...) codebase for research, reading, learning (generally any task that does not require adding code to codebase) you MUST NEVER add/edit/update/remove/write any code to project's codebase

### Principle 3: Your Behavior as an Assistant
- **Clarify, Don't Assume:** If a requirement is ambiguous or context is missing, your first action is to ask for clarification.
- **No Hallucinations:** Do not invent libraries, functions, or file paths.
- **Plan Before You Code:** For any non-trivial task, first outline your implementation plan in a list or with pseudocode.
- **Explain the "Why":** For complex or non-obvious blocks of code, add a `# WHY:` comment explaining the reasoning behind the implementation choice.

### Principle 4: Code Formatting in Responses
- **Shell Commands/Scripts:** NEVER add line numbers or vertical lines in code blocks containing shell commands or scripts
- **Reason:** Line numbers prevent users from copying and pasting commands directly
- **Good Example:**
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/project
  rm -rf old_files/
  echo "Done"
  ```
- **Bad Example (DO NOT USE):**
  ```
  1 | cd /path/to/project
  2 | rm -rf old_files/
  3 | echo "Done"
  ```
- **Exception:** Code references to EXISTING files in the codebase should use the `startLine:endLine:filepath` format for navigation
- **Rule Summary:** Plain code blocks for commands to execute, line references only for existing code
